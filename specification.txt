Slow down - do this first: Combine the elements of the existing text adventure into one full game.
Add the concept of health so a player can be instantly killed, or just damaged.
Introduce a degree of randomness into the game so there's not a fixed set of instructions that guarantee success.
Make enemies instances of a class so that they can be reused/generated
Randomise the safe combination
Passage -> Cave -> Hall -> Study -> Hall --> Outside?
Rooms should be an object as well so they can have generated information instead of hard-coded

class Location
  def initialize(type)
    @room_type = type
  end

  def movement
  end
end
